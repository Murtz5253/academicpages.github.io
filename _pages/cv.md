Research Interests
======
* Computer Science and Data Science Education
* Learning Sciences
* Data Visualization

Education
======
* Ph.D., Human-Centered Design and Engineering (conc. Computing Education and Learning Sciences), University of Washington, 2026 (expected)
* M.S., Human-Centered Design and Engineering, University of Washington, 2023
* B.A., in Applied Mathematics, UC Berkeley, 2021

Research Experience
======
* **Learning and Design Lab, University of Washington (2022 - Present)**
  * Working on the development of tools and curricula for the joint teaching of computer science and data visualization.
* **Human-Centered Data Science Lab, University of Washington (2021 - Present)**
  * Working on the design of a novel visualization known as the BeadPlot which is aimed at visualizing the text of research papers to allow researchers to draw information from them more quickly.
* **RISE Lab, UC Berkeley (2020-2021)**
  * Worked on the CovidVis project. Studied the impact of visualizations on user perception of COVID-19 intervention measures and the potential to utilize visualizations more effectively to better convey key insights from data.
* **Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Summer 2018)**
  * Developed methods to analyze climate simulation data for robust tropical cyclones using in-house program TECA—Toolkit for Extreme Climate Analysis.

Industry Experience
======
* **2Sigma School, Learning Sciences Researcher (Contract, Jun 2023-Present)**
  * Working on the development of novel techniques to construct and deliver introductory computer science and data science courses.
* **UpLimit, Course Instructor and Course Development Partner (Contract, Mar 2023-Present)**
  * Actively teach and manage one of Uplimit's highest-rated courses, the Python Crash Course.
  * Assist in the development of introductory data science and visualization courses.
* **Nutanix, Software Engineering Intern (Summer 2020)**
  * Worked with the Acropolis Hypervisor Team in order to improve efficiency and decrease workload within Nutanix’s hypervisor product. Set the stage to eventually achieve a 60% reduction in the amount of time one of the processes in the Acropolis system spends on a compute-heavy task.
