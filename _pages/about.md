I am a PhD Student in Human-Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington, working with Dr. Cecilia Aragon and Dr. Sayamindu Dasgupta. I earned my B.A. in Applied Mathematics from UC Berkeley, with a focus in Computer Science.

My most recent work focuses on improving introductory programming education through a creative learning lens. My broader research interests center around computing education and data visualization. I am particularly interested in the design, teaching, and structure of introductory computing and data courses. I have taught introductory courses at various levels, including at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels, as well as for industry learners interested in advancing their careers.
