Social Recommender Algorithms (SRAs) often function on large training datasets, comprised of user-generated content that they
acquire from the usersâ€™ online activities. However, there are several problematic aspects of SRA design, such as obtaining truly
informed consent from users before using their data, and potential intended or unintended harms caused by SRAs. At the heart of
such problems lies the dehumanization of users by these algorithms, as they reduce users to data points. This working paper presents
ongoing work in developing a framework of recommendations for a Human-Centered Data Science approach to SRA design.
